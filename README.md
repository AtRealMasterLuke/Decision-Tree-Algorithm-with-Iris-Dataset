# Decision Tree Classification on the Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Decision Tree algorithm to classify the Iris dataset.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample has four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Algorithm Used
The Decision Tree classification algorithm is used to build a model that classifies the iris species based on the given features. The implementation leverages the `scikit-learn` library.

## Results & Visualization
The notebook includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Training a Decision Tree model
- Model evaluation and accuracy
- Visualization of the decision tree
